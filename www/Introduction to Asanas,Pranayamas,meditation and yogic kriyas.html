Asanas<p>
The meaning of the Sanskrit word asana is ‘a steady and comfortable posture’. The postures performed in all yoga practices (Hatha Yoga and Ashtanga Yoga ) are called asanas. Although many people believe that they are physical exercises, it does not convey their full significance. ‘Asanas aim at influencing the body, mind and consciousness, molding and yoking them into one harmonious whole’. The practice of asanas requires active involvement of one’s entire being as fully as possible. In other words, try not to think about work or friends or food while performing them!<p>

The prime aim of asanas is to help us tread the path to higher consciousness so we can begin to understand and know our relationship with existence. We cannot even consider attaining higher awareness if we are ill with disease, aches and pains or mental depression. Therefore, the initial purpose of practicing asanas is to eliminate these disturbances and afflictions. A regular practice of asanas makes us acquainted with the way our body is, and we then begin to understand the importance of breathing and staying still. The opening up of the body that results after a regular practice gives us a sense of freedom not only in the body, but more importantly in the mind driving us to come to terms with whatever is happening in our mind.<p>

The practice of asanas should not be divorced from the other aspects of Yoga. All Yoga techniques have the purpose of leading each of us to higher awareness. The ancient Yogis aimed at transcending the normal limitations of the mind and body. Their aim was to transcend individuality and to achieve self realization. In this context, asanas were not intended specifically to develop the mind and body. This was a means to an end. Their aim was to make the body so perfect and the subconscious mind so calm and trouble free that these aspects of individual existence could be forgotten. When the aches and pains and ailments of the body are removed and one is emotionally and mentally relaxed, then one automatically ceases to be aware of the physical body and the superficialities of the mind. In this way the fetters of individuality can be released and one’s true nature- pure, infinite, all pervasive consciousness- can be realized.<p>
Pranayama<p>

Yoga breathing exercises, also known as pranayama, are an important part of a developing yoga practice. Pranayama is one of the Eight Limbs of Yoga referenced by The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, which means that it was considered an integral step on the path to enlightenment. In addition to supporting and deepening your yoga asana practice, learning ways to calm or invigorate the body through breathing will greatly benefit all aspects of your life.<p>

Paying attention to the breath is also a meditation technique that can be used on or off the mat, as it has the effect of keeping us constantly in the present moment. The past and the future melt away when the mind becomes fully focused on breathing. <p>
Pranayama Exercises <p>
Three-Part Breath - Dirga Pranayama <p>
A good breathing exercise for beginners. Doing three-part breath teaches you how to fill and empty the lungs completely, which is important because you're probably not used to using your full lung capacity. It's also a nice way to transition into your yoga session. <p>

Equal Breathing - Sama Vritti Pranayama <p>
Taking long, deep, slow breaths has a relaxing effect on the body. Bringing your full attention to keeping your inhalations and exhalations the same length occupies your mind, giving it a much need break from its usual hum of activity.  <p>

Alternate Nostril Breathing - Nadi Sodhana <p>
In nadi sodhana, you block off one nostril, exhaling and inhaling through the open passageway before switching sides. This helps bring you into balance by clearing the energy channels on both sides of the body. <p>

Cooling Breath - Shitali Pranyama <p>
A simple breath, perfect for a hot day or when the body is warm after practicing yoga postures. <p>
Ocean Breath - Ujjayi Pranayama <p>
Ujjayi breath is really interesting because it acts to calm the sympathetic nervous system at the same time as it boosts your oxygen consumption. It is the primary breath used in vinyasa yoga because it is powerful enough to support a vigorous flow. <p>

Lion's Breath - Simhasana <p>
Lion's breath releases the tension in your face and helps you blow off some steam. You can do it anytime during a yoga practice. <p>

Skull Shining Breath - Kapalabhati Pranayama <p>
This is advanced breathing exercise should ideally be learned from an experienced teacher, as it is possible to become lightheaded if it is done incorrectly. Once mastered, this breath generates heat and clears the nasal passages.  <p>
Meditation <p>
Meditation is a practice where an individual operates or trains the mind or induces a mode of consciousness, either to realize some benefit or for the mind to simply acknowledge its content without becoming identified with that content, or as an end in itself.<p>

The term meditation refers to a broad variety of practices that includes techniques designed to promote relaxation, build internal energy or life force (qi, ki, prana, etc.) and develop compassion, love, patience, generosity, and forgiveness. A particularly ambitious form of meditation aims at effortlessly sustained single-pointed concentration meant to enable its practitioner to enjoy an indestructible sense of well-being while engaging in any life activity.<p>

The word meditation carries different meanings in different contexts. Meditation has been practiced since antiquity as a component of numerous religious traditions and beliefs. Meditation often involves an internal effort to self-regulate the mind in some way. Meditation is often used to clear the mind and ease many health concerns, such as high blood pressure,depression, and anxiety. It may be done sitting, or in an active way—for instance, Buddhist monks involve awareness in their day-to-day activities as a form of mind-training. Prayer beads or other ritual objects are commonly used during meditation in order to keep track of or remind the practitioner about some aspect of that training.<p>

Meditation may involve generating an emotional state for the purpose of analyzing that state—such as anger, hatred, etc.—or cultivating a particular mental response to various phenomena, such as compassion. The term "meditation" can refer to the state itself, as well as to practices or techniques employed to cultivate the state. Meditation may also involve repeating a mantra and closing the eyes.The mantra is chosen based on its suitability to the individual meditator. Meditation has a calming effect and directs awareness inward until pure awareness is achieved, described as "being awake inside without being aware of anything except awareness itself.In brief, there are dozens of specific styles of meditation practice, and many different types of activity commonly referred to as meditative practices.<p>
Kriya Yoga<p>
Kriya Yoga is described by its practitioners as the ancient Yoga system revived in modern times by Mahavatar Babaji through his disciple Lahiri Mahasaya,  Kriya Yoga was brought to international awareness by Paramahansa Yogananda's book Autobiography of a Yoga  and through Yogananda's introductions of the practice to the west from 1920.<p>

According to Yogananda the ancient Yogic text the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, contains a description of Kriya Yoga  "Liberation can be attained by that pranayama which is accomplished by disjoining the course of inspiration and expiration.<p>

The Kriya yoga system consists of a number of levels of pranayama, mantra, and mudra based on techniques intended to rapidly accelerate spiritual development and engender a profound state of tranquility and God-communion. Yogananda attributes his description of Kriya Yoga to his lineage of gurus, Sri Yukteswar Giri, Lahiri Mahasaya, and Mahavatar Babaji . The latter is reported to have introduced the concept as essentially identical to the Raja Yoga of Patanjali and the concept of Yoga as described in the Bhagavad Gita.
