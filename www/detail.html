The word "yoga" comes from the Sanskrit root yuj,
which means "to join" or "to yoke". <P>
Although the true meaning of the word "Yoga" is complex, and has seemingly endless branches and interpretations, the literal translation from the Sanskrit word (one of the world's oldest, most beautiful and enduring languages) means "union" or "to yoke". When we refer to Yoga facilitating the union of mind, body and spirit, we are literally referring to yoking or joining them in a mindful or conscious way. It's the fundamental goal of Yoga, whether it's specifically defined that way or not. Originating from India over 5,000 years ago, it was essentially handed down from generation to generation through oral tradition. It wasn't until around 200 B.C. that the Indian sage Patanjali compiled the teachings into what's known as the "Yoga Sutras of Patanjali". The Yoga Sutras are the basis of today's yoga philosophy and also provide practical instructions on how to achieve the benefits of yoga. The benefits and praises of yoga were also eloquently illustrated in about 500 B.C. by the sage, Vyasa, who wrote the famous Bhagavad Gita. These two great literary works provide us with the first and most significant written definitions of Yoga. <P>

Important of Yoga<p>
In 2014, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi suggested United Nations to celebrate June 21 as the International Yoga Day as it is the summer solistice; the longest day of the year in the Northern Hemisphere.<p>

"Yoga is an invaluable gift of India's ancient tradition. This tradition is 5000 years old. It embodies unity of mind and body; thought and action; restraint and fulfilment; harmony between man and nature; a holistic approach to health and well-being. It is not about exercise but to discover the sense of oneness with yourself, the world and the nature. By changing our lifestyle and creating consciousness, it can help in well being . Let us work towards adopting an International Yoga Day." —?Narendra Modi, UN General Assembly, September 2014.<p>



Yoga is not a religion; it is a way of living that aims towards 'a healthy mind in a healthy body'.<p>

Man is a physical, mental and spiritual being; yoga helps promote a balanced development of all the three. Other forms of physical exercises, like aerobics, assure only physical well-being. They have little to do with the development of the spiritual or astral body.<p>

Yogic exercises recharge the body with cosmic energy and facilitates:<p>

Attainment of perfect equilibrium and harmony<p>
Promotes self- healing.<p>
Removes negative blocks from the mind and toxins from the body<p>
Enhances personal power<p>
Increases self-awareness<p>
Helps in attention, focus and concentration, especially important for children<p>
Reduces stress and tension in the physical body by activating the parasympathetic nervous system<p>
The aspirant feels rejuvenated and energized. Thus, yoga bestows upon every aspirant the powers to control body and mind.<p>
