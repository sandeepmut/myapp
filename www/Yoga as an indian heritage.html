The origins of yoga are a matter of debate. There is no consensus on its chronology or specific origin other than that
yoga developed in ancient India. Suggested origins are the Indus Valley Civilization (3300–1900 BCE) and pre-
Vedic Eastern states of India, the Vedic period (1500–500 BCE), and the srama?a movement.According to Gavin
Flood, continuities may exist between those various traditions:<br>
[T]his dichotomization is too simplistic, for continuities can undoubtedly be found between renunciation
and vedic Brahmanism, while elements from non-Brahmanical, Sramana traditions also played an
<center><img src="c1.jpg"></center>
important part in the formation of the renunciate ideal.<br>
Pre-philosophical speculations of yoga begin to emerge in the texts of c. 500–200 BCE. Between 200 BCE–500 CE
philosophical schools of Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism were taking form and a coherent philosophical system of
yoga began to emerge. The Middle Ages saw the development of many satellite traditions of yoga.Yoga came to the
attention of an educated western public in the mid 19th century along with other topics of Indian philosophy.<p>
Pre-vedic Period<p>
Yoga may have pre-Vedic elements. Some state yoga originated in the Indus Valley Civilization.Marshall,
Eliade and other scholars suggest that the Pashupati seal discovered in Indus Valley Civilization sites depict figures
in positions resembling a common yoga or meditation pose. This interpretation is considered speculative and uncertain
by more recent analysis of Srinivasan and may be a case of projecting "later practices into archeological findings<p>
Vedic period <p>
According to Crangle, some researchers have favoured a linear theory, which attempts "to interpret the origin and early
development of Indian contemplative practices as a sequential growth from an Aryan genesis",just like
traditional Hinduism regards the Vedas to be the ultimate source of all spiritual knowledge. Thomas McEvilley
favors a composite model where pre-Aryan yoga prototype existed in the pre-Vedic period and its refinement began in
the Vedic period.<p>
Ascetic practices, concentration and bodily postures described in the Vedas may have been precursors to yoga.
According to Geoffrey Samuel, "Our best evidence to date suggests that [yogic] practices developed in the same ascetic
circles as the early sramana movements (Buddhists, Jainas and Ajivikas), probably in around the sixth and fifth
centuries BCE.<p>
According to Zimmer, Yoga philosophy is reckoned to be part of the non-Vedic system, which also includes the
Samkhya school of Hindu philosophy, Jainism and Buddhism: "[Jainism] does not derive from Brahman-Aryan
sources, but reflects the cosmology and anthropology of a much older pre-Aryan upper class of northeastern India
[Bihar] – being rooted in the same subsoil of archaic metaphysical speculation as Yoga, Sankhya, and Buddhism, the
other non-Vedic Indian systems.<p>
Upanishad<p>
The first known appearance of the word "yoga", with the same meaning as the modern term, is in the Katha Upanishad probably composed between the fifth and third century BCE, where it is defined as the steady control of
the senses, which along with cessation of mental activity, leading to a supreme state. Katha Upanishad
integrates the monism of early Upanishads with concepts of samkhya and yoga. It defines various levels of existence
according to their proximity to the innermost being Atman. Yoga is therefore seen as a process of interiorization or
ascent of consciousness. It is the earliest literary work that highlights the fundamentals of yoga. White states:
The earliest extant systematic account of yoga and a bridge from the earlier Vedic uses of the term is
found in the Hindu Katha Upanisad (Ku), a scripture dating from about the third century BCE[…] [I]t
describes the hierarchy of mind-body constituents—the senses, mind, intellect, etc.—that comprise the
foundational categories of Samkhya philosophy, whose metaphysical system grounds the yoga of the
Yogasutras, Bhagavad Gita, and other texts and schools (Ku3.10–11; 6.7–8).
The hymns in Book 2 of the Shvetashvatara Upanishad, another late first millennium BCE text, states a procedure in
which the body is held in upright posture, the breath is restrained and mind is meditatively focussed, preferably inside
a cave or a place that is simple, plain, of silence or gently flowing water, with no noises nor harsh winds.<p>
The Maitrayaniya Upanishad, likely composed in a later century than Katha and Shvetashvatara Upanishads but
before Patanjali's Yoga Sutra, mentions sixfold yoga method – breath control (pranayama), introspective withdrawal
of senses (pratyahara), meditation (dhyana), mind concentration (dharana), philosophical inquiry/creative reasoning
(tarka), and absorption/intense spiritual union (samadhi).
In addition to the Yoga discussion in above Principal Upanishads, twenty Yoga Upanishads as well as related texts such
as Yoga Vasistha, composed in 1st and 2nd millennium CE, discuss Yoga methods.<p>
Sutra Period<p>
Yoga is discussed in the ancient foundational Sutras of Hindu philosophy. The Vaise?ika Sutra of the Vaisheshika
school of Hinduism, dated to have been composed sometime between 6th and 2nd century BCE discusses Yoga.
According to Johannes Bronkhorst, an Indologist known for his studies on early Buddhism and Hinduism
and a professor at the University of Lausanne, Vaise?ika Sutra describes Yoga as "a state where the mind resides only in
the soul and therefore not in the senses".This is equivalent to pratyahara or withdrawal of the senses, and the
ancient Sutra asserts that this leads to an absence of sukha (happiness) and dukkha (suffering), then describes
additional yogic meditation steps in the journey towards the state of spiritual liberation.
Similarly, Brahma sutras – the foundational text of the Vedanta school of Hinduism, discusses yoga in its sutra 2.1.3,
2.1.223 and others.Brahma sutras are estimated to have been complete in the surviving form sometime between
450 BCE to 200 CE, and its sutras assert that yoga is a means to gain "subtlety of body" and other powers.
The Nyaya sutras – the foundational text of the Nyaya school, variously estimated to have been composed between the
6th-century BCE and 2nd-century CE, discusses yoga in sutras 4.2.38–50. This ancient text of the Nyaya school
includes a discussion of yogic ethics, dhyana (meditation), samadhi, and among other things remarks that debate and
philosophy is a form of yoga.<p>
Modern period<p>
Yoga came to the attention of an educated western public in the mid-19th
century along with other topics of Indian philosophy. In the context of this
budding interest, N. C. Paul published his Treatise on Yoga Philosophy in
1851.<br>
The first Hindu teacher to actively advocate and disseminate aspects of yoga
to a western audience, Swami Vivekananda, toured Europe and the United
States in the 1890s. The reception which Swami Vivekananda received
built on the active interest of intellectuals, in particular the New England
Transcendentalists, among them Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803–1882), who
drew on German Romanticism and the interest of philosophers and scholars
like G. W. F. Hegel (1770–1831), the brothers August Wilhelm Schlegel
(1767–1845) and Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel (1772–1829), Max
Mueller (1823–1900), Arthur Schopenhauer (1788–1860), and others who
had (to varying degrees) interests in things Indian.
Theosophists also had a large influence on the American public's view of
Yoga.Esoteric views current at the end of the 19th century provided a
further basis for the reception of Vedanta and of Yoga with its theory and practice of correspondence between the
spiritual and the physical.The reception of Yoga and of Vedanta thus entwined with each other and with the
(mostly Neoplatonism-based) currents of religious and philosophical reform and transformation throughout the 19th
and early 20th centuries. M. Eliade, himself rooted in the Romanian currents of these traditions, brought a new
element into the reception of Yoga with the strong emphasis on Tantric Yoga in his seminal book: Yoga: Immortality
and Freedom. With the introduction of the Tantra traditions and philosophy of Yoga, the conception of the
"transcendent" to be attained by Yogic practice shifted from experiencing the "transcendent" ("Atman-Brahman" in
Advaitic theory) in the mind to the body itself.
The American born yogi by the name of Pierre Arnold Bernard, after his travels through the lands of Kashmir and
Bengal, founded the Tantrik Order of America in 1905. His teachings gave many westerners their first glimpse into the
practices of yoga and tantra.
